"""Normalize one reported HLA typing string to the current release.

Rules (also stated in harbor/hla-typing-report-normalize/instruction.md):
1. A string listed in Deleted_alleles.txt is deprecated; follow its successor (may be a prefix today).
2. Else a pre-2010 colon-less string is deprecated; convert 2-digit fields to colon form (Cw -> C).
3. Else the string must be an assigned name or a valid lower-resolution prefix in this release.
4. Otherwise it is unresolvable.
Then: members = the full alleles the name identifies; allele_2field = 2-field name + the expression
suffix all members share (if any); g_group = the single shared G group, NONE if none, AMBIGUOUS if mixed.

Reported-typing shorthands accepted as input (each leaves a flag so nothing is converted silently):
- An ``HLA-`` prefix is dropped: the release files carry none, and ``HLA-A*02:01:01:01`` must
  resolve exactly like ``A*02:01:01:01``.
- G and P group names (``A*02:01:01G``, ``DPB1*04:01P``) resolve to themselves with
  ``g_group_name`` / ``p_group_name``; their members are the group's members. NGS reports are
  routinely issued at G-group resolution, so a typing made of G groups must check and match.
- ``A*02:XX`` (the XX code: any allele in the first-field family) resolves to the first-field
  prefix with ``xx_code``.
- ``A*02:01g`` (two-field "lg" notation, py-ard ``lg``) resolves to the two-field prefix with
  ``lg_notation``.
- NMDP multiple allele codes (``A*02:AB``) are recognised but NOT expanded: they need the NMDP
  MAC table, which this build does not load. They return unresolvable with ``mac_code`` so a
  caller can tell "we could not check this" from "this name does not exist".
- The legacy ``Cw`` locus label on a colon-style name (``Cw*07:02``, ``Cw*07:XX``) resolves as
  the ``C`` name with ``deprecated_name``, like the colon-less ``Cw*0702`` always has.
